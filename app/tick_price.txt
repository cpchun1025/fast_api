To monitor over 1,000 tickers in real-time, you need a robust and scalable infrastructure, with efficient coding practices and data management. Here's a more detailed outline for setting up such a system:

### 1. Choose a Real-Time Data Provider
Find a financial data provider that offers comprehensive real-time data for the Hong Kong stock market. Examples include:

- Bloomberg Terminal
- Refinitiv Eikon (formerly Thomson Reuters)
- Interactive Brokers API
- IEX Cloud (offers some international data)

Each of these services comes with its own API, cost structure, and limitations. You will need to review their offerings to find the best fit for your specific needs.

### 2. Obtain API Access
Register for the service and get your API key or access credentials. Keep in mind that streaming real-time data for a large number of tickers might require a special subscription plan. 

### 3. Plan Your Data Model and Storage Solution
Decide on a database that can handle high-frequency writes and reads. In-memory databases like Redis, time-series databases like InfluxDB, or traditional databases with good indexing like PostgreSQL can be considered, based on your requirements.

### 4. Implement WebSocket or Streaming API Connection
Depending on your data provider, you will either use WebSockets or a streaming API to receive the data. Here's an example of how you might handle multiple WebSocket connections with Python's `asyncio`:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

async def subscribe_to_ticker(websocket, symbol):
    subscribe_message = json.dumps({
        "method": "SUBSCRIBE",
        "params": [
            f"{symbol}@ticker"
        ],
        "id": 1
    })
    await websocket.send(subscribe_message)

async def ticker(websocket, symbol):
    await subscribe_to_ticker(websocket, symbol)
    while True:
        response = await websocket.recv()
        data = json.loads(response)
        # Process the data (e.g., store it in a database)
        print(f"Ticker for {symbol}: {data}")

async def main(symbols):
    connection_tasks = []
    websocket_uri = "wss://api.yourprovider.com/ws"
    
    async with websockets.connect(websocket_uri) as websocket:
        for symbol in symbols:
            task = asyncio.create_task(ticker(websocket, symbol))
            connection_tasks.append(task)

        await asyncio.gather(*connection_tasks)

symbols = [f"{i:04}.HK" for i in range(1, 1001)]  # Generate a list of ticker symbols in the format 0001.HK to 1000.HK

asyncio.run(main(symbols))
```

### 5. Handle Data Stream
The above script demonstrates how to connect to a WebSocket and listen for data on multiple tickers. The `main` function handles the orchestration of tasks for each symbol.

### 6. Build a Monitoring System
For the front-end, you might want to use a framework like React.js or a dashboard tool like Grafana, which can connect to your database and display real-time updates.

### 7. Ensure Compliance and Efficiency
Make sure your implementation does not violate the data provider's terms and that your code efficiently handles the incoming data without memory leaks or excessive CPU usage.

### 8. Testing
Test your system with simulated data first to make sure it can handle the load and updates the front-end in real-time without crashing or slowing down.

### 9. Deployment
Deploy your system on a server with sufficient resources to handle the workload. Cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure offer scalable compute instances.

### 10. Monitoring and Maintenance
Set up monitoring to alert you to any issues with the system, and plan for regular maintenance and updates.

### Note on Practicality
Handling 1,000+ real-time tickers is a serious task typically undertaken by financial institutions with the necessary resources and infrastructure. It requires a dedicated development team, significant financial investment, and ongoing operational management.

Before embarking on such a project, it's important to thoroughly understand the costs, both in terms of API subscription fees and infrastructure, and to evaluate if the benefits justify these costs. If you're not part of an institution with these capabilities, it may be more practical to look for existing platforms that can provide the information you need.
